## 🎯 The Problem

macOS users can type `2+3*5` in Spotlight and instantly get `17`. Windows users? They have to:
1. Open Calculator app
2. Type the expression
3. Copy the result
4. Switch back to what they were doing

**Not anymore.**

## ✨ The Solution

```bash
# Install once
npm install -g mani-calc
mani-calc install

# Use forever
# Just type in Windows Search:
calc: 2 + 3 * 5          → 17 ✨
calc: 10 km to miles     → 6.21 miles ✨
calc: what is 25% of 200 → 50 ✨
```

Results appear instantly. Auto-copied to clipboard. Pure productivity.
```

## 🎯 Summary

**Recommendation: Keep it Windows-focused**

This gives you:
- ✅ Clear, compelling value proposition
- ✅ Underserved market (Windows users)
- ✅ Strong positioning ("Spotlight for Windows")
- ✅ Simpler codebase
- ✅ Better marketing story

The description emphasizes:
1. **The gap**: Windows lacks Spotlight's calculator
2. **The solution**: Mani-calc fills it
3. **The benefit**: Same productivity as macOS users

This is much stronger than "cross-platform calculator CLI" which would compete with hundreds of existing tools.
